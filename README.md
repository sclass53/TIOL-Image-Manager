Supports **MacOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**. 

All photos stay on your own hard drive. AI inference runs completely offline. No cloud services required.

## Features

- 🔍 **AI Powered Dual Search**: **Semantic search** (simply describe what you're looking for, e.g., *"a cup of coffee"*) + **Tag search** (fast)

- 📄 **Filter redundant images**: One-click organization of redundant and blurry/overexposed images.

- 📚 **Albums**: user albums plus lens & color smart groups; multi-select import and drag-and-drop.

- 💻 **Multiplatform support**: Supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Supports Nvidia CUDA, cpu, Apple CoreML，etc.

- ⚡ **Lightweight**: ~50MB in size，single exe and system onnx driver，provides portable editions。

- 📷 **Lens/Focal length filtering**: Filter the photos through specifying the lens/the focal length.

- 📁 **Directory Management**: Add/remove photo directories, file system monitoring (new/modified files are automatically queued for processing)

- 🏷️ **Custom Labels**: AI tagging – enter any labels (Chinese or English) in the Tags tab; files are indexed automatically on changes.

- 🖥️ **AI Engine Options**: auto / GPU / CPU / Apple CoreML (macOS native Neural Engine acceleration) – fully local

- 🔒 **Model Lockdown**: SHA256 checksum + resumable downloads + fallback to domestic mirrors, auto‑repair for corrupted models

## Installation

[Releases](https://github.com/sclass53/TIOL-Image-Manager/releases)

[Official Website (With Releases)](https://tiol.netlify.app)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Dependencies: Rust 1.70+, tauri-cli 2.x (macOS also needs Xcode CLT; Windows needs VS Build Tools)
cargo tauri dev        # development mode
cargo tauri build      # production build (Windows → msi/nsis, macOS → .app/dmg)
```

On first launch, the AI model (~412 MB) will be downloaded automatically (mirror chain: hf‑mirror → openi → huggingface).  
**Before building/running on Windows**, copy `vendor/onnxruntime/win-x64/onnxruntime.dll` to the same directory as the executable.  
**On macOS**, you need a universal2 `onnxruntime.dylib` (official builds include CoreML EP) – see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for details.
